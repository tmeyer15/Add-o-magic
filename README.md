Add-o-magic
===========

Add-o-magic automatically adds courses, increasing the likelihood of getting into them. It can also drop/add when a spot opens.

These are Greasemonkey (just download the add-on) scripts that run in Firefox. The URLs must be kept up to date each semester.

The Course_add_bot will simply add the requested courses over and over again every couple seconds until you get in.

The Course_reqeust_bot will look for when a class becomes open, drops your conflicting class, and then adds the one you like. (This is dangerous thoughâ€¦ When I used it it dropped my class and someone else added the class I wanted in the 5-second time it took for the script to attempt to add it.)
